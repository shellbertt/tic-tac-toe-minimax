CMPUT 274, Fall 2020, Weekly Exercise #6 Object Oriented Minimax

The submission is a python module that demonstrates the minimax algorithm by
using an ai that plays tictactoe converted to object oriented design. I do not
think there are any other special running instructions or special cases.

I had a couple questions; they are inline on lines 231, 240, 272.
